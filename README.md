# About
cocktailist is a cocktail listing/browsing/rating app built on Rails and Backbone,
created largely to satisfy my own perceived need to keep track of all the bars
and specialty drinks I've had. Users can:

- Create accounts
- Create sessions (log in)
- Create cocktail entries
- Review cocktails
- View cocktail summaries and reviews/scores
- Add cocktails to lists
- Search for cocktails

### Bugs To Fix
- [ ] Floats on some browse pages is misaligned

### To Do
- [x] Integrate Google API to Bar info
- [ ] Tag cocktails (i.e. spicy, adventurous, traditional, etc.)
- [ ] Browse cocktails by tag
- [ ] Get recommendations based on drinking history, tags, and location
- [ ] A 2-d graph view of cocktails, plotted out based on tags, if I can find a way to quantify the tags
- [ ] Ability to follow users, comments on their activity, etc
- [ ] Filter activity feed (3 types: add, rate, and list activities)
- [x] Pagination/infinite scroll on the recommendations page/lists page
- [ ] Smart search (i.e. autocomplete words)
- [ ] "Sticky" the Google map on browse pages to top of screen so it remains in sight when scrolling
